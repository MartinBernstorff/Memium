<!-- start short-description -->

When you have to stop and look things up, it breaks up your flow. Adding this knowledge to long-term memory builds fluency, and being fluent at something makes it much more fun! The faster you can get from crawling to running, the more enjoyable it is.

Unfortunately, we forget most of what we read, [even stuff we care about](https://andymatuschak.org/books/).

It turns out that if you ask questions of the texts you read, and ask those questions of yourself in the future, you learn much more! But writing questions and quizzing yourself can feel quite mechanical. What if you wrote questions as part of your notes, and then your computer could quiz you in the future? That's the purpose of Memium. It extracts questions from your notes like 

```
Q. Why can spaced repetition result in more enjoyable learning?
A. It enables faster bootstrapping to proficiency, which is more fun!
```

And adding them to a spaced repetition service like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). 

This is an implementation of Andy Matuschak's [Personal Mnemonic Medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/The_mnemonic_medium_can_be_extended_to_one%E2%80%99s_personal_notes).

<!-- end short-description -->

## Use as an application
If you want to sync markdown notes to Anki, here's how to get started!

1. In Anki, install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on

### Command line interface
2. Install Memium in its own virtual environment with pipx,

```bash
> pipx install memium
```

3. Import your notes!

```cli-block
> memium --input-dir [YOUR_INPUT_DIR]
```

### In Docker container
2. Install [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) or Docker Desktop. 
3. Setup a container
```bash
$INPUT_DIR="PATH_TO_YOUR_INPUT_DIR"

docker run -i \
  -e HOST_INPUT_DIR=$INPUT_DIR \
  -v $INPUT_DIR:/input \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/martinbernstorff/memium:latest \
  memium \
  --input-dir /input/
```

This will start a docker container which updates your deck from `$INPUT_DIR`. In case of updated files, it will sync the difference (create new prompts and delete deleted prompts) to Anki. If you want to continuously sync the directory, check out the documentation for the `cli`.

## Use as library
If you would like to build build your own Python application on top of the abstractions added here, you can install the library from pypi:

```bash
pip install memium
```

### Pipeline abstractions
The library is built as a pipeline illustrated below. The left path describes the abstract pipeline, defined by abstract interfaces. The right path describes implementation I use, and which is part of this repo. 

```mermaid

graph TD 
	FD["File on disk"]
	FD -- Document ingester --> Document
	Document -- Prompt extractor --> Prompt
	Prompt -- Destination --> Card 
 
	MD["Markdown file"]
	 Prompts["[QAPrompt | ClozePrompt]"]
  Cards["[AnkiQA |¬†AnkiCloze]"]
 
	MD -- MarkdownDocumentIngester --> Document
	Document -- "[QAPromptExtractor, \nClozePromptExtractor]" --> Prompts
	Prompts -- AnkiConnectDestination --> Cards
 ```
