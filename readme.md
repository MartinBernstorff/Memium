# Personal Mnemonic Medium
## What This Is
![Tests](https://github.com/MartinBernstorff/personal-mnemonic-medium/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)]

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is awesome. It allows you to retain information for much longer than you would have before. 
Beyond the boring memorisation many of us were taught in school, committing things to long-term memory allows much greater fluency, since you don't have to pause and look things up.. 
This means you can bootstrap into a new field rapidly, which makes the learning process much more fun! The faster you can get from crawling to running, the more enjoyable it is. 

This holds doubly true if you can put the information into contex, for example using a [Zettelkasten](https://medium.com/@martinbernstorf/why-you-need-an-idea-management-system-defb5de44746).

This thinking is largely inspired by Andy Matuschak's [Personal Mnemonic Medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/The_mnemonic_medium_can_be_extended_to_one%E2%80%99s_personal_notes), and the code is based on the unmaintained [Ankdown](https://github.com/benwr/ankdown).

This is FYI-style open source, maintenance is not guaranteed.
